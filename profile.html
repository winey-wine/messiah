        <p class="bio">Hello! I am Messiah Rouienne C. Absalon, but my family and friends call me Wine, I'm a student, a daughter, and a believer. I am a passionate individual who loves to watch and read anime and comics, read books, and a person who finds solace in painting, and peace in her religion. Welcome to my profile page!

  <p class="bio">Every person has a unique story, and mine is one filled with passion, challenges, and unwavering faith. My name is Messiah Rouienne C. Absalon, but most people call me Wine. I was born on October 20, 2009, and I am currently in my final year of Junior High School. As a proud member of the Special Program in the Arts, I express myself through visual artistry, using my creativity to bring my thoughts and emotions to life. 
 
 <p class="bio">I don’t have a lot of friends, and I consider myself an ambivert. Most of my trust issues come from past friendships that left me questioning people’s intentions. Overthinking is something I constantly struggle with, but I try my best to navigate through it. Even though I don’t open up easily, I find solace in the things I love—reading mangas and books, watching anime and K-dramas, and immersing myself in stories that take me to different worlds. </p>

<p class="bio">Looking ahead, I have big dreams for myself. I aspire to be a successful businesswoman, a fashion designer, and a writer. These goals may seem ambitious, but I believe that with passion, hard work, and faith, I can achieve them. Life has tested me in many ways, but I know that my journey is just beginning, and I am determined to create a future where I can thrive and inspire others.</p>
