        <h2>Pre-School</h2>
    <img src=" IMG_20250119_153953.jpg" alt="School Picture" class="school-image">

        <p>The early years of my childhood were filled with wonder, curiosity, and a thirst for learning. Though my memories of preschool are scattered, certain details still linger, painting a picture of the foundation that shaped my academic journey.</p><p>

I first attended preschool in San Jose, Antique, Brgy 2, Bantayan St. The name of that school escapes me, but the experiences I had there were significant in setting me on the path of learning and achievement. Later, I moved to Palma, Barbaza, where I attended kindergarten at Jinalinan-Ipil Elementary School. The schoolyard, though now distant in my mind, must have been filled with laughter and play.</p><p>
 
Though I don’t recall the names of my teachers, I know they played a crucial role in my early development. Their lessons, patience, and guidance helped shape my understanding of the world and nurtured my love for learning.</p><p>

During those years, my favorite color was blue—a hue that perhaps symbolized the vast possibilities ahead of me. My favorite snack was EC chocolate flavor, a treat that surely brought comfort and joy during school breaks. These small details, though seemingly insignificant, add warmth to the fragments of my memories.</p><p>

Though my recollections of preschool are not entirely clear, I know that it was a time of growth, discovery, and unwavering support from my family. Those early experiences set the stage for the person I would become, and for that, I really am grateful, especially to God who gave me my life.</p>

        
        <h2>Elementary</h2>
    <img src="  IMG_20210926_170839.jpg" alt="School Picture" class="school-image">

        <p>My elementary school years were filled with growth, learning, and unforgettable experiences. Each grade brought new challenges, friendships, and moments that shaped my journey as a student and as a person.</p><p>

I began my elementary education in Palma, Barbaza, at Jinalinan-Ipil Elementary School. In first grade, I loved drawing with Crayola, but one particular incident remains vivid in my memory. I had drawn a sun in a peculiar way, only for a classmate to accuse me of copying his work. The mix of sadness and frustration I felt in that moment was strong, but despite that, I continued to excel academically.</p><p>

After first grade, I transferred to Atabay Elementary School in San Jose, Antique. In second grade, I had a unique experience when I joined a Miss UN pageant. I remember wearing a beautiful pink Filipiniana gown. That year, I did not receive any honors, but the experience was memorable and helped me build confidence.</p><p>

Third grade was a time of change. I was placed in Class A, where I made many new friends. I also had my first real crush, who was in another section. I ranked 17th on the honor list, a significant achievement, and even learned how to do a split! My teacher, Ma'am Gimeno, played a big role in making learning enjoyable.</p><p>

In fourth grade, I was placed in Section Jade. Our teacher, Ma'am Mericar, was an amazing singer and taught us how to sing. It was a fun and exciting year, especially because my crush from the previous year was now in the same section as me. This made the school year even more special.</p><p>

Fifth grade was filled with adventure and chaos. Our school was under construction, which meant we had to move classrooms frequently. This made learning more challenging but also more exciting. My crush changed that year, and another significant event occurred—a fire broke out at our school. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but it was a frightening experience that I will never forget.</p><p>

By sixth grade, everything changed again. The pandemic hit, and face-to-face classes were no longer possible. Instead of spending my final elementary year in a classroom, I spent it at home with my family, focusing on worshiping God and cherishing the time we had together. Though it was not the ending I had expected, it was a year of reflection and gratitude.</p><p>Looking back, my elementary years were a mix of happiness, challenges, and growth. Each grade taught me something new, and every experience—big or small—helped shape who I am today. I am grateful for the teachers, friends, and moments that made these years truly special.

       <h2>Junior High School</h2>
      <img src="  FB_IMG_1739886268002.jpg" alt="School Picture" class="school-image">
        <pMy junior high school years at Antique National School (ANS) have been a journey of growth, challenges, and self-discovery. From the nerve-wracking entrance test for the visual arts major to navigating the ups and downs of each grade, these years have shaped me in ways I never expected.</p><p>

Seventh grade was a unique experience as it was conducted through modular and online classes. I don’t remember much, but I do recall feeling overwhelmed by the workload. However, one thing stood out—I got to experience painting for real this time, and it felt amazing. It was a moment of realization that I truly belonged in the Special Program in the Arts (SPA).</p><p>

Eighth grade was my first year attending ANS in person, and adjusting was difficult. The unfamiliar environment and the fact that my former classmates were in regular classes while I was in SPA made it lonely at first. But as time passed, I found my place, made new friends, and slowly settled into the rhythm of my new school life.</p><p>

Ninth grade was brutal. The heavy workload, endless tests, and numerous projects made it one of the most challenging years yet. However, despite the struggles, I still found joy in the little moments, proving that even in tough times, there are always good experiences to hold on to.</p><p>

I used to envy the tenth graders. Almost every time we had a test, activity, or lesson, I would see them outside, seemingly free from academic pressures because their teachers were either absent or busy. I couldn’t wait to be a tenth grader myself. But as much as I wanted to reach this stage, I was also nervous. Teachers constantly reminded us that tenth-grade teachers were very strict when it came to grades.</p><p>

Now that I am in tenth grade, I realize that this year is a mix of emotions—fun, sadness, and a rollercoaster of experiences. Some unfortunate accidents and drama have occurred in my life, but I choose not to dwell on them for now. Despite everything, I am grateful for the two loyal friends who have stayed by my side through it all.</p><p>

Being an ambivert, I often find myself balancing between socializing and enjoying solitude. Junior high school has tested me in many ways, but it has also allowed me to grow, adapt, and understand myself better. As I move forward, I carry with me the lessons and memories that have shaped these years, preparing me for the next chapter of my life.
