    <h1> Specialization </h1>
    <p>My name is Messiah Rouienne Absalon and ever since I was in 7th grade I was already a part of the Special Program in the Arts. And I applied for the major of Visual Arts. Every quarter our teacher would assign as of an artwork be it in a canvas or ina "banig", using oil, acrylic, or water color. And I will show you some of my artworks from 7th grade up to this date. I hope you guys enjoy my art journey!</p>
